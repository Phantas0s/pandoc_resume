I'm a French software developer, happily coding as a hobby for 20 years and professionally for 10 years. Today, I'm doing mostly backend web development using PHP and Golang. Learning is another passion of mine; that's why I'm never shy to work with new technologies or even new languages.

Other than that, I love writing, reading, climbing, and photography. I always try to connect these different interests to see in new lights what I'm doing every day. The goal is to improve my creativity and the overall quality of my work. Writing, for example, as a lot in common with coding software, and I try to practice both every day.

Making mistakes is for me a chance to learn and improve. I don't like blames and I'm always trying to have a teaching-learning relationship with each of my colleague, because I truly believe we can teach to anybody and learn from anybody.

I need to have a strong sense of purpose in my work. Knowing that it has a positive impact on society is, by itself, a great reward for me. It's true at every level: I love to share my knowledge, find effective solutions, receive and give constructive feedback, and take decisions always depending on what I'm building and for whom. The goal is to always have a positive impact.

I believe as well that a good software is the result of an effective collaboration with developers, project managers, and domain experts. That's why I like to work as close as possible with all of them.
